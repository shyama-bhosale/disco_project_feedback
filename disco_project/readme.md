Project Requirements
1. Skip the registration part, assume users are created via the admin panel.
2. Users should be able to do the following:
a. Upload images via HTTP request
b. List their images
3. There are three account tiers â€“ Basic, Premium and Enterprise.
    - Users that have a "Basic" plan after uploading an image get:
        - A link to a thumbnail that's 200px in height
    - Users that have a "Premium" plan get:
        - A link to a thumbnail that's 200px in height
        - A link to a thumbnail that's 400px in height
        - A link to the originally uploaded image
    - Users that have an "Enterprise" plan get:
        - A link to a thumbnail that's 200px in height
        - A link to a thumbnail that's 400px in height
        - A link to the originally uploaded image
        - Ability to fetch a link for a previously uploaded image that expires after a number of seconds (user can specify any number between 300 and 30000)

4. Admins should be able to create arbitrary plans with the following
configurable attributes:
    - Thumbnail sizes
    - Presence of the link to the originally uploaded file
    - Ability to generate expiring links
5. Admin UI should be done via django-admin
6. There should be NO custom user UI (just browsable API from DRF)
